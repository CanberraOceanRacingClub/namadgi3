# Navigating Batemans Bay

Namadgi 3 will be located at the Batemans Bay Marina from September to December 2017. This affords CORC 
members the opportunity access the boat with a short drive from Canberra. It also offers some 
lovely cruising spots up and down the NSW coast.

The Committee has noted that Bateman's Bay is open waters and presents a range of challenges to skippers and
crew beyond those found in Pittwater.

The purpose of these notes is to alert Members to a number of navigational challenges that may be met while 
sailing Namadgi 3 in and around Bateman's Bay

## Open Waters of the Bay

Pittwater is a well protected area in which we have enjoy cruising without significant seas or swell.
Bateman's Bay however, is classified 
as open waters. It offers minimial protection from ocean swells and sea waves.

* do not venture into the Bay if you are concerned about your open water seamanship skills
* consider inviting a member who is experienced with Bay Sailing to help you on your first outing -- a few names
are listed below
* be prepared to deal with sea sickness amongst the crew
* obtain weather forcasts and take early action to avoid being caught in a Southerly change or strong NE blow common
during summer afternoons


## Tidal waters
The maximal tidal range at Bateman's Bay is around 2.0m -- strong currents result and there are many shallow areas. 
Skippers must always be aware of the up to date tidal predictions and take these into account while navigating the Bay and
the Clyde River. [Willey Weather tides](http://tides.willyweather.com.au/nsw/south-coast/snapper-island.html) 
provides excellent information for tides at the Bay.


## The leads

The best passage across the Clyde River Bar is marked by leads which consist of two triangular panels that appear one above
the other as you approach the rock wall. At night these panels are lit with conspicuous purple lights.

The lead direction are 

* arrival: 280 deg T (or 267 deg M)
* departure: 100 deg T (or 87 deg M)

To be *on the leads* steer to maintain the two panels (or lights) one vertically above the other. If you drift from 
the leads you will notice them separate. Quickly steer to reestablish the alignment

## The Clyde River Bar

This river bar is located about 200m off the end of the rock wall. It is an extended area of shallows with a sandy bottom.
It's charted depth is only 0.8m however after recent dredging locals report the charted depth to be now 1.2m

It's shallow depth and the likelyhood of breaking waves in heavy seas means that the bar must be treated with 
the utmost respect.

* If unable to cross the bar when returning from sea, pick up a mooring at North Head (or anchor behind Snapper Island) and
wait for conditions to improve

The bar is generally well marked but does move. Consult with a locals to see if the leads are set correctly before
crossing. Also check to see if depth of bar has changed (Marina manager Damon will be very helpful). There is also a 
[bar webcam](http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/maritime/using-waterways/web-cameras/batemans-bay.html) that may be worth checking before you venture out.


## Crossing the bar

Any river bar crossing is a potentially dangerous activity and requires good seamanship from both skipper and Crew. Here 
are some general rules about crossing the bar at Batemans Bay

* Check tides to ensure adequate water for Namadgi 3's 2.2m draft
* The bar is best cross at high tide, slack water 
* Make allowance the height of the sea waves on the bar. A 1m sea across the bar will reduce the effective water depth by 0.5m
* Approach and depart the bar along the marked leads -- see notes above
* NSW law requires ALL crew to wear PFDs while crossing the bar in either direction. This is policed 
stringently and there is a big fine for non compliance
* If in doubt do not cross the bar

Here are some precaustion specific to entering or leaving the river
`
### Entering the river 

When approaching the Bar from Sea:

* ensure everyone is wearing a PFD -- stiff fines apply and you will be prosecuted for any failures in this regard
* start the motor and drop the main sail and furl the headsail
* by the time you are abeam snapper Island you should have located the marker panels 
and established yourself on the leads with a heading of 280 deg T (or 267 deg M). 
* observe the conditions on the bar -- abort and stand off if conditions look too dangerous
* If unable to cross the bar, pick up a mooring at North Head (or anchor behind Snapper Island) and
wait for conditions to improve
* if ok, proceed slowly across the bar keeping the vessel at 90 degrees to any following sea
* keep sufficient water speed to maintain steerage (especially if the tide is flooding)
* once across the bar stay on the leads until you are about 50 off the rock wall then 
* turn to staboard and steer for the starboard lateral (green) mark off the stone wall on the northern side of the channel
* leave this and other starboard lateral (green) marks to starboard  as you motor up the river (beware the sand bank close
to starboard)
* maintain sufficiuent speed through the water to maintain steerage (remember there may be as much as a 4 knots of flood current)


### Leaving the river

When leaving the river to go into the Bay

* ensure everyone is wearing a PFD -- stiff fines apply and you will be prosecuted for any failures in this regard
* proceed under motor -- do not put up sails in the river
* having departed the marina, motor down the river keeping to the right of the channel (but not too close to the rock wall)
* maintain sufficiuent speed through the water to maintain steerage (remember there may be as much 
as a 4 knots of ebb current)
* as you approach the end of the rock wall, observe the state of the bar. If it looks dangerous, abort and return to the 
marina
* if continuing motor 50m past the end of the rock wall and make a sharp turn to startboard making your heading due south
* wait until the lead markers appear then steer to port to establish your new heading on the leads
* Proceed slowly across the bar (maintaining enough speed to maintain steerage)
* Remain on the leads until you are clear of Snapper Islands to starboard


## Clyde River Bridge
The bridge over the Clyde River at Batemans Bay is a local icon. It's lifting span allows some sailing vessels to access
the river up to Nelligen. 

*DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE NAMADGI 3 UNDER THE BRIDGE*  

N3's air draft is 21m and the bridge span only lifts to 20m -- N3 will NOT fit under the bridge. Even if N3 were able to pass the 
bridge, greater dangers lerk. The High Voltage power cables upstream of the bridge sit only 15m abover the high water mark and
represent a potential fatal hazard to N3 crew. 

DO NOT attempt to take N3 upstream of the bridge under any circumstances.

## Tidal currents

Tidal currents in the Clyde River can be very strong. Expect to experience currents of up to 4 knots during spring tides. Currents
are particularly strong around "The Race", an area of narrow and shallow water at the western end of the rock wall between
the marina and the township.  

Avoid this area except during slack tide.

## Marina Entrance
The Batemans Bay Marina is accessed via a relatively narrow gap in the rock wall that runs east/west along the river's southern 
side. Entering and leaving the marina can be hazardous.

### When exiting

* Crew to keep a close watch for vessels and other water traffic moving along the river
* Ensure the river is clear both ways before venturing out (foredeck hand should explicitly call "clear port", "clear starboard")
before leaving
* Beware the tidal flow when exiting -- strong currents may take N3 sidewards into the rock wall if you linger in the entrance
* Be prepare with an "Engine failure plan" -- should N3's engine fail on departure be prepare to deploy the headsail to gain
way and steerage.
* All crew to wear life jackets before departure from the berth
* Brief the crew on these procedures before departure
* Clear the marina before raising any sail (except in an engine fail emergency)

### When entering

* Watch for traffic exiting the marina -- standoff if in doubt -- do not force a presumed right of way
* Drop all sails before attempting to enter the marina
* Watch (fore and aft) for traffic in the river before turning into the gap in the wall
* Anticipate the tidaly flow -- when N3's keel is turn across the flow expect N3 to start moving sideways with respest to the gap 
in the wall
* Start your turn at some distance out from the wall, maintain way and steerage as you approach the gap, assess your leeway, abort
the approach if in doubt
* Once committed, proceed promptly into the Marina while observing the 4knt speed limit

## Sandbars

Beware of the sand bars on the northern side of the river channel. These extend from the bar all the way up to the bridge.

## Raising and lowering sails

Sails should not be raised until over the bar on the way out and before crossing on the way in 
unless you are confident of where the sandbar lies outside the marina entrance.

## Acheron Ledge

Reef Point is located on the northern side of the bay just east of Maloneys Beach in Chain Bay. As the name suggests, a
substantial reef known as Acheron Ledge, extends south into the bay for a considerable distance off the point. The charted depth of the reef is around 1.2m
Rocks at the end of the reef break at low tide. Uncomfortable seas can develop in the vacinity of the reef.

Acheron Ledge is a significant hazard with many local vessels having met with disaster on the ledge over the years. Great
care is required to avoid this hazard. Some computerised charts show cardinal marks around the reef. Legend has it that these were blown away in storms several 
years ago and, for some unknown (and possibly stupid reason) they have never been replace.

Acheron Ledge is shallow, dangerous, unlit and unmarked. It is a hazard to vessels entering the bay from the North and to those
using the bays and beaches along the northern side. 

Local advice is to keep the Clyde River Bridge structure in view while navigating the northern part of the Bay. If the
bridge becomes occluded by North Head, you may be in danger of going aground on Acheron Ledge.  

Lives have been lost in this area. Please take extreme care.

## Long beach

There are bommie s at the Eastern end of Long Beach that can be tricky.

## Snapper Is to Observation point

The area between Snapper Island and Observation point is shallow and dangerous -- stay clear.

## Denham's Beach reef

When travelling between Casey's Beach and Surf Beach stand well off shore to avoid the reef 
which extends a consdierable distance from the point at the Northern end of Danham's beach.

## Black Rock

This small but prominant island is a hazard located off Lilli Pilli at the southern end of the bay. The island is 
unlit and care must be taken when entering or leaving the bay (from/to) the south, especially at night.

## Casey's Beach Reef

Casey's Beach is a lovely spot to anchor for an while expecially in a westerly. Beware the adminreef off the beach. 
It is marked with a West cardinal mark indicating clear water to the west. It is best to stay on the north side 
of the cardinal mark when approaching the beach. Generally stand well off the beach as the bottom shallows quickly.

## Anchorages

Good anchorages nearby include 

* in the Lee of Broulee Island, 
* Maloneys Beach 
* Snapper Island (there is a public mooring here)

If planning on Anchoring at the East end of Maloney Beach check weather forecast carefully. 
If there is any South in the forecast forget it.

## Marine Rescue Batemans Bay

Marine Rescue Batemans Bay ([website here](http://www.marinerescuebatemansbay.com/))is available on VHF 16 and can help with anything from emergency response to simple advise as to
the state of the bar. Call them up on VHF16 or phone (02) 4472 3060 or mobile 0488 723 070.

## Fishing

* There are extensive marine reserves in the Bay where fishing is prohibited or restricted. Ensure you know where these
area are before fising
* See the [government website](http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/marine-protected-areas/marine-parks/batemans-marine-park) for more information on the Batemans Bay Marine Park
* refer to the [Marine Park zoning map](http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/656288/bmp-zoning-map.pdf)
* Alway have a current fising licence

## SARWATCH

Namadgi is registerd with Bateman Bay Marine Rescue and has been allocated the VHF radio callsign of ``BM ???``.

Skippers taking Namadgi 3 out onto the Bay or further afield are *strongly advised* to log your intended passage with Marine
Rescue Batemans Bay who will then maintain a SARWATCH on you until your return. If the event that you fail to return (or report daily) they
will activate procedures to ensure your safety. This may include raising a full scale search and rescue incident.

There is a SOP describing the procedure for reporting to Maritime Rescue.
