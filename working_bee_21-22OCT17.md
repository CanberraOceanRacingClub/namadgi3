## Task list

Here is the [working bee list](https://github.com/CanberraOceanRacingClub/namadgi3/labels/Working%20bee) generated from
issues with the ``working bee`` label.

## Some guidelines

This from the committee:

```
We discussed at the Committee meeting last night just to be legal meeting Roads and Maritime laws. For that I think we only need:

Re-use 6 x Marlin PFDs without harnesses. They are currently in self test - no cost
V sheet
Bailing bucket
Torch
Flare kit – check dates
EPIRB – still fitted
VHF Radio - still fitted
 
A lot of the other stuff on my list hopefully can be found in the store or scrounged or is not needed for a basic legal requirement.
I’m still seeking feedback from BME on the state of the solar panels. Currently they do not work.
Cheers,
Dave
