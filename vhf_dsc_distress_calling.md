# DSC Distress Calls

When you make a DSC distress call, your call is transmitted to all DSC-capable radios within receiving range. 
Your current GPS position (latitude and longitude) and the current time are included in the transmission.
You should familiarize yourself with the standard distress-call format and protocol to ensure that your calls are 
clear and effective.

## Sending an Undesignated Distress Call
When you send an undesignated distress call, the nature of your emergency is not transmitted to the receiving stations.
Sending an undesignated distress call is a shorter and quicker procedure that can save you time during an emergency.

1. Lift the spring-loaded door, and press and hold the DISTRESS key for at least three seconds. The transceiver beeps, 
and the screen displays “DISTRESS CALL COUNTING DOWN”. The channel pane counts down the seconds from 3 to 1.
2. The radio automatically sounds an alarm, switches to Channel 70, and transmits your call on HI (25 W) power. 
You can press any key to turn off the alarm sound.
3. After transmitting your distress call, the radio automatically tunes to Channel 16 on HI (25 W) power. 
Press the PTT key on the handset and speak your message.

The radio waits for an acknowledgement (ACK) on Channel 70
from a listening station. 
Repeat the voice message as oftern as is necessary to get an acknowledgement.


## Sending a Designated Distress Call
When you send a designated distress call, the nature of your emergency is transmitted to the receiving stations.

   * FIRE
   * FLOODING
   * COLLISION

   * CAPSIZING
   * SINKING
   * ADRIFT

The radio waits for an acknowledgement (ACK) from a listening station.

## Waiting for a Distress Call Acknowledgement
If the radio does not receive a distress call acknowledgement, the radio retransmits the distress call at a random time
between 3.5 and 4.5 minutes. This process is repeated continually until the radio receives an acknowledgement.

## Receiving a distress call acknowledgement

1. When the radio receives a distress call acknowledgment, the radio beeps and the screen displays ``DISTRESS ACK``. 
Press any key to turn off the beeping.
1. Select ``down arrow button`` to view additional information. If the MMSI of the station transmitting the ACK signal is an entry 
in your directory, the name associated with the MMSI number is indicated on the screen. If not, 
the screen displays the MMSI number.
3. Select ``ACCEPT``.

## Stopping Automatic Retransmission of Distress Calls

To stop the radio from automatically retransmitting a distress call, select ``CANCEL``. 
The radio remains tuned to Channel 16. Selecting ``CANCEL`` does not communicate to other stations that you no longer have 
an emergency. Selecting ``CANCEL`` only stops the automatic repetition of the call. For information on revoking a distress call,
see below.

## Revoking a Distress Call

A DSC distress call is not transmitted until you press and hold the ``DISTRESS`` key for at least three seconds. 
However, if you inadvertently make a DSC distress call or are no longer in distress, it is important to cancel 
the call immediately by transmitting a voice message to All Stations on Channel 16.

1. Select ``CANCEL`` to cancel the distress alert, and wait until the screen displays ``DISTRESS CANCEL HAS BEEN SENT``
1. Press the 16+ key. The radio tunes to the Channel 16
1. Press the PTT key on the handset and speak a voice message to cancel the 
distress alert
